* Function: InitFlash()
* Description: Initializes the F2837xD flash timing registers.
* Notes:
*  1) This function MUST be executed out of RAM.  Executing it out of
*     OTP/FLASH will produce unpredictable results.
*
*  2) The flash registers are code security module protected.  Therefore,
*     you must either run this function from secure RAM, or you must
*     first unlock the CSM.  Note that unlocking the CSM as part of the
*     program flow can compromise the code security.
*
* 3) The latest datasheet for the particular device of interest should
*    be consulted to confirm the flash timing specifications.
